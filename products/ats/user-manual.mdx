# 1. Introduction

The Echo ATS Test System is a USB 2.0 compliant audio test platform compatible with ASIO and WASPI drivers on Windows computers and Core Audio on Macintosh (Mac) computers. When coupled with a computer running test software, ATS forms a complete system for testing digital and analog audio electronics and acoustics in consumer and professional products. Echo ATS products are ideally suited for a high-volume production environment where testing occurs on a continual basis.

Echo ATS combines the functionality of multiple pieces of test equipment into a single, integrated device for increased reliability at a reduced cost. In addition to audio testing, it has the capability to control measurement fixtures.

**Figure 1 Echo ATS Test System**

# 2. Installation

## Hardware

Connect the locking power cable supplied with the ATS to the locking IEC C14 power inlet. Both locking and non-locking cables may be used. The RGB LED on the front panel indicates when power is applied and the ATS is operating. The universal AC input accepts 90 – 264 VAC at 50 or 60 Hz. The ATS, equipment connected to the ATS, and the test computer must all be connected to the same surge-protected power strip.	

![A picture containing light, adapterDescription automatically generated][image3]

**Figure 2 Locking power cable**

Connect the supplied USB-C cable to the USB-C connector on the back of the ATS, and the other end to the host computer. 

## Echo Driver Software

For Windows computers, download the ATSWindows driver from the downloads section of the Echo website and run the installer. This will install the ATS control panel, the latest firmware, the ASIO driver, and the command-line application. Although the ATS will automatically be recognized on Windows 10 or 11 and can function using only Windows’ built-in WASAPI driver, we recommend installing the Echo software to add control panel functionality, firmware updates, and ASIO driver support. Most professional audio and test applications support ASIO. The driver will appear in your software as “ASIO Echo ATS”.

For MacIntosh computers, support for USB audio is part of the macOS and its audio component, Core Audio. The ATS is automatically detected whenever it is powered on and connected to a Mac USB port.

## 3rd Party Test and Measurement Software

The Echo ATS Test System may be used with a wide variety of 3rd party test and measurement software via the Echo ATS ASIO driver. Because ASIO is a digital interface, all levels are communicated between the hardware and software as digital values, and there’s no inherent conversion to actual analog I/O values when using an analog interface. To properly do the conversion, the software needs to know the correct scaling factor, which defines the relationship between analog voltage and digital full-scale level (0 dBFS). The scaling factors for different types of inputs and outputs are typically different. For example, the scaling factor of a line-level output will be different than for a speaker output, because the maximum voltage of a speaker output is much greater.

Although scaling factors can be determined by experimentation using a calibrated voltage meter, we provide you with the correct scaling factors for our hardware, so that you can simply enter these values into the appropriate settings in the measurement software that you are using.

**Table 1 Scaling factors**

|  | IO Type | Scaling Factor |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Outputs** | Line (unbalanced) | 8.0 V/FS |
|  | Line (balanced) | 16.0 V/FS |
|  | Headphone | 3.0 V/FS |
|  | Amplifier/Speaker | 9.545 V/Fs |
| **Inputs** | Mic-Line | 161.6 mFS/V |
|  | Headphone Impedance VMON | 333.3 mFS/V |
|  | Headphone Impedance IMON \* | 8.0 FS/V |
|  | Speaker Impedance VMON | 80.80 mFS/V |
|  | Speaker Impedance IMON \* | 161.6 mFS/V |

# 3\. ATS Control Panel

## Overview

The control panel controls and monitors the following ATS hardware functions:

* Analog input and output gain  
* Constant-current power to microphones  
* TEDS data  
* Level meters  
* Firmware update  
* WASAPI and ASIO driver settings  
* Clock source and status  
* Diagnostic logging and directory


The tabs and drop-down menus are described in the text that follows. If the control panel is not already installed, please see the *Echo* Driver Software section on page . **The control panel is for ATS hardware control only. It does not perform any audio analysis.**

Channels Tab

The Echo Acoustic Test System  Inputs and Outputs are configurable for testing different types of devices ( ie Acoustic, line level, headphone, or spreaker). When  you configure ATS IO for testing different types of devices it adjusts the relative voltage and phase based on the desired setup.

![][image4]

**Figure 3 Channels tab (ATS-SH)**

## Options Tab

The Options tab contains information about the connected ATS test system and allows various configuration options to be set. Its controls and indicators are described below.

![][image5]

**Figure 21 Options tab**

### Device

**Serial Number:** Unique serial number for the device. This can also be found on the bottom of the unit.

**Firmware:** Displays the current firmware version and allows you to manually update or revert to the factory supplied version.

**Auto-update firmware:** When checked, you will be prompted to update the firmware if the control panel includes a later version than is already installed.

**Logging:** Enables diagnostic logging. You typically do not need to enable logging unless requested by Echo support.

**Log directory:** Directory where the log file will be stored.

### Clock

**Source:** Selects the clock source as Internal (the ATS’s built-in crystal oscillator).

**Sample rate:** Shows the ASIO clock rate selected in the measurement software.

### Control Panel

**Show window when ATS connects:** Shows the control panel window when the ATS test system is connected.

**Show system tray icon:** Shows the control panel icon in the system tray when running.

**GPU accelerated rendering:** When checked, allows the GPU (graphics card) to offload from the CPU the task of redrawing of the control panel meters.

### Driver

**Version:** Currently installed driver version.

**ASIO name:** Shows the name of the Echo ASIO driver as it will be displayed in the measurement software.

**Windows system audio (WASPI):** Enables the Windows WASAPI audio driver. Leave this unchecked unless you are running software that only supports WASAPI and does not support ASIO.

## File Menu

![Graphical user interface, textDescription automatically generated][image6]

**Figure 22 File menu**

The File menu allows you to open and save sessions. An ATS session stores all the current hardware settings in a text file that can be used to reset the hardware to a previous state.

Additionally, the ATS command-line application can read session files, so you can fully configure the ATS, save the configuration as a session, and then later load all those settings using a single command-line call.

It is not usually necessary to directly edit the session file, as the easiest way to construct it is simply to set the control panel up as desired and then save the session. It can be, however, be easily edited in a text editor. The format is generally self-explanatory, however it is further described in the ATS Command-line Reference, which may be downloaded from the website.

## Help Menu

The Help menu contains a single item: “About ATS Control Panel”.  The “About” window shows the version number and build date of the currently installed control panel application.

![][image7]

**Figure 23 ATS “About” window**

# 4\. Analog Outputs

## Output Channels Tab

The left side of the tab shows the output channels. The output level of each channel is displayed both on a horizontal bar graph (**A**) and numerically (**B**). 

Use the drop-down control to select the desired units (**C**). 

On Channels 1 and 2 click the **LINE AMP** or **HP** (**D**) to change the output mode. **IMPORTANT** Changing the output mode adjusts the relative voltage and phase of the output port. See below for specific details.

Click the caret (**E**) to expand or condense the channel display for each module type. In the condensed view, only the bar-graphs are visible.

![][image8]

**Figure 4 Output channels**

**Table 2 Output Configurations**

| Mode | Configuration | DC Offset | Max output | Ground  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **AMP** | Floating  | 7.5V | 12.4Vpp | Do NOT Connect |
| **HP**  | Single-ended | 0V | 8.5Vpp | Required (shared) |
| **LINE** | Balanced | 0V | 22.6Vpp | Optional |

## 

## Amplifier Outputs (**AMP**)

The Amp / Speaker outputs are designed for making basic acoustic measurements of a device under test (DUT)—typically a speaker or driver. Ideal for use with measurement microphones, ear simulators, artificial heads, speakers, actuators, and mouth simulators. When one of the ATS outputs is set to **AMP**, it individually maps to the audio driver as an output channel. Euroblock output connectors 1 \- 4 are provided for driving speakers or other devices in **AMP** mode. The outputs are single ended with (+) and (-) connections and the speaker should be connected directly across them. Both the (+) and (-) outputs are biased at \~7.5V.

**Note:**  Amplifier outputs are floating and not ground-referenced. Connecting a speaker or other low-impedance path from one of the outputs to ground will cause the amplifier to shut down. The amplifier will reset and resume normal operation after the fault is removed.

Analog output channels 1 and 2 can be configured as **AMP** outputs by clicking the AMP button on the Analog Out sections of the channels tab. Channels 3 and 4 may only be used as **AMP** outputs.

## **Figure 5: Speaker connection in AMP mode. Connect speaker across \+ and \- terminals only (floating differential output, 7.5V DC bias, 12.4Vpp maximum). Do NOT connect ground terminal**

![][image9]

**Figure 6: Analog outputs 1 \- 4  set as AMP / Speaker (AMP)**

## Headphone Outputs (**HP**)

The Headphone (HP) output mode is designed for making advanced acoustic and impedance measurements of a device under test (DUT)—typically wired headphones, headsets, earbuds, and hearing protection devices. When output  channels 1 or 2 are set to **HP** mode they map to the audio driver as output channels. 

Euroblock output connectors 1 and 2 are configurable for driving headphones and earbuds. The Left and Right outputs are single-ended and share a common ground.

Clicking the **HP** button in the analog outputs section of the Channels tab configures the outputs as headphone (**HP**) outputs.

**Figure 7 Headphones connected in HP mode. In phase 8.5Vpp and 0V DC offset. Ground connected to both drivers.**

![][image10]

**Figure 8: Analog outputs 1 and 2 set as Headphone outputs (HP)**

## 

## Line-level Outputs (**Line**) 

The Line-level (**LINE**) output mode is designed for making basic acoustic and electrical measurements of a device under test (DUT). It features balanced line outputs, which are useful both for interfacing to balanced audio devices, and for interfacing to single-ended devices where ground isolation is desired. When output  channels 1 or 2 are set to **LINE** mode they map to the audio driver as output channels. The outputs may be connected in single-ended (unbalanced) mode by connecting to the \+ and ground terminals and leaving the – terminal floating (unconnected).

The ATS supports configuring Euroblock outputs 1 and 2 for connecting line-level devices. The outputs are differential with (+), (-), and ground connections.

**Figure 10: Analog outputs 1 and 2 set as Line Level (LINE)**

# 5\. Analog Inputs

## Microphone / Line Inputs

Inputs with BNC connectors are available for connecting externally polarized or prepolarized constant current (CCP/IEPE/ICP, 4 mA) microphones, or unbalanced line-level inputs. Input gain control, constant current supply, DC coupling, and TEDS reading are available at each input and are under software control via the ATS control panel.

The mic/line inputs are designed to accommodate a very wide range of input voltages, from extremely low-level dynamic microphones all the way to line level inputs. To cover such a wide range of voltages, four input gain levels (+10 db, \+20 db, \+30 db, \+40 db) are available. The gain settings are individually adjustable for each channel. Keep in mind that setting the input gain higher will also amplify the noise floor, so the best practice is to use the lowest gain setting needed for a particular application. This will result in the best dynamic range for the measurements.

![][image12]

**Figure 11: Simplified Circuit Diagram of a single Input Channel.** 

### Inputs Channel Tab

Input channels are similarly shown on the right side of the Channels tab. The input level of each channel is displayed both on a horizontal bar graph (**A**) and numerically (**B**). Use the drop-down control to select the desired units (**C**). 

Mic/line inputs contain the following additional controls:

**TEDS:** Displays the TEDS (Transducer Electronic Data Sheet) information reported back from the attached microphone, if the microphone supports it (**D**). See the TEDS section below for more details.

**Gain:** Sets gain to \+10 db, \+20 db, \+30 db or \+40 db to accommodate a wide range of signal levels (**E**).

**CC:** Toggle the constant current supply (CCP/IEPE/ICP) to power prepolarized measurement microphones (**F**).

**DC:** Toggle DC coupling (**G**)

**MIC/LINE \- Loopback \- Impedance:**  Input channel 1 and 2 can be set to Mic/Line input or Loopback. Channel 2 through 8 can be used to measure impedance of the DUT. See section below for more details. (**H**)

Click the caret (**J**) to expand or condense the channel display for each module type. In the condensed view, only the bar-graphs are visible.

![][image13]

**Figure 12:  Input channel**

### TEDS

When the TEDS button is clicked, the TEDS data window will be displayed. If the attached microphone does not support TEDS, then a message “TEDS device not found” will be shown instead of the data.

**Figure 18 TEDS data window**

TEDS data is not automatically transferred to the audio analysis software—it must be copied and pasted or manually entered into the appropriate field(s). Data may easily be copied by clicking the icon to the right of each line.

Sensitivity is displayed by default in units of Volt/Pascal. Some audio test software, such as Audio Precision’s APx500 Flex, requires the sensitivity data to be entered in units of Pascals/Volt (also called the “scaling factor”).  Checking the “Show inverse units” checkbox at the bottom will switch the “Sensitivity @ reference condition” units to Pascals/Volt.

## Impedance

The ATS measures impedance of connected devices by simultaneously monitoring voltage and current at Output 1\. This allows you to characterize speakers, headphones, drivers, and other loads across different frequencies in any output mode (LINE, HP, or AMP).

### How Impedance Measurement Works

The impedance measurement system monitors two parameters:

* Voltage Monitoring (VMON): Input 3 measures the voltage at the output terminals  
* Current Monitoring (IMON): Input 4 measures the current through the load via a built-in 0.1Ω precision current sense resistor (two 0.2Ω 5% resistors in parallel)

The current sense resistor is permanently connected in series with the positive (+) terminal of Output 1\. This resistor is not externally accessible.

### Configuring Impedance Measurement

#### To enable impedance measurement:

1. Connect your device under test (DUT) to the Output 1 three-pin connector (+, \-, and ground)  
2. In the ATS Control Panel, navigate to the Channels tab  
3. In the Analog In section, use the dropdown menus for Inputs 3 or 4 to select "Impedance"  
4. When set to Impedance mode:  
* Input 3 automatically switches from Mic/Line to VMON  
* Input 4 automatically switches from Mic/Line to IMON  
* The ADC channels for inputs 3 and 4 are now dedicated to impedance measurement

### Important Notes

Impedance measurement is currently available only on Output 1

Inputs 3 and 4 function as standard Mic/Line inputs when not in Impedance mode

The measurement accuracy specifications can be found in the Specifications section:

Headphone outputs: ≤ 1% (20 Hz – 20 kHz)

Amplifier/Speaker outputs: ≤ 0.5% (20 Hz – 20 kHz)

![][image14]

### Loopback

The ATS includes an internal loopback feature that electronically routes outputs directly to inputs via relays. This allows for system verification, self-calibration, and custom test configurations without requiring external cabling.

The loopback system routes outputs to specific inputs as follows:

Table 3: Loopback Routing

| Outputs | Routes to Inputs(s) |
| :---- | :---- |
| Output 1 | Input 1 and 3 |
| Output 2 | Input 2 |
| Output 3 | Inputs 5 and 7 |
| Output 4 | Inputs 6 and 8 |

**Note:** Input 4 is not available for loopback as it is dedicated to current monitoring (IMON) through the sense resistor for impedance measurements.

### **Configuring Loopback**

To enable loopback:

1. In the ATS Control Panel, navigate to the Channels tab  
2. In the Analog In section, use the dropdown menu for the desired input channel  
3. Select **"Loopback"** from the dropdown menu  
4. The corresponding output will automatically route to that input channel

### **Operating Characteristics**

* **Output Mode Compatibility:** Loopback functions in all output modes (LINE, HP, and AMP)  
* **Available Controls:** When in loopback mode, you can:  
  * Adjust input gain settings (+10dB, \+20dB, \+30dB, \+40dB)  
  * Read TEDS information  
* **Disabled Features:** The following input features are disabled during loopback:  
  * Constant current supply (CC)  
  * DC coupling control

# 6. Digital I/O

The ATS includes SPDIF digital audio input and output on BNC connectors located on the rear panel. The system provides two input channels and two output channels that can operate simultaneously with the analog I/O.

### Specifications

The digital interface uses consumer SPDIF format (IEC60958) with 24-bit resolution and supports standard sample rates from 44.1 kHz to 192 kHz. The SPDIF signal is self-clocking, extracting timing from the digital stream itself.

Digital channels map to the ASIO driver as:

* Input: Channels 9 and 10  
* Output: Channels 5 and 6

### Control Panel

In the Channels tab, the Digital In and Digital Out sections show real-time levels for channels Dig 1 and Dig 2\. Levels display in either dBFS or percentage.

![][image15]![][image16]

The Options tab contains a Digital I/O dropdown menu to select between:

* SPDIF Mode: Standard digital audio operation  
* Word Clock Mode: Synchronization input/output

![][image17]

### Word Clock Mode

When set to Word Clock mode, the system can accept an external word clock for synchronization or generate a word clock output. The Options tab displays the detected input frequency when a word clock signal is present. A 75Ω termination option ensures proper impedance matching.

## Aux (GPIO)

The ATS features 4 TTL level inputs and 4 open drain TTL level outputs capable of sinking up to 250mA of current on a female 9 pin locking D-sub connector. They allow sending and receiving switch closure information under program control for interfacing to other test or display devices. A simple application of this feature would be to illuminate a Pass/Fail light-bar based on test results.

# 9. Programmatic Control

## Command-line Application

The command-line application is primarily used for configuring an ATS test system from another application. This is especially useful if you want to automate setting up your ATS as part of your test sequence.

The ATS command-line app can also be used to control your ATS from the Windows command prompt or macOS terminal.

On Windows, the command-line application is installed when you install the Echo ATS Driver.

On macOS, no driver installation is necessary. Just copy the command-line application and the required EchoATSInterface.dylib library to a folder on your hard drive.

Documentation of the command-line calls is available in a separate document, the ATS Command-line Reference, which may be downloaded from the Echo Test+Measurement website.

## API

ATS includes a C library dll which makes it possible to control the ATS test system from a variety from your own code. For documentation, refer to the ATS API Reference, which may be downloaded from the Echo Test+Measurement website.

## LabVIEW Driver

The ATS LabVIEW driver, which includes a package of Vis for controlling the ATS and retrieving data, is available for download from the Echo Test+Measurement website.
