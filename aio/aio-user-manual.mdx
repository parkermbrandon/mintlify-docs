# 1. Introduction

The Echo AIO Test System is a USB 2.0 compliant audio test platform compatible with ASIO and WASAPI drivers on Windows computers and Core Audio on Macintosh (Mac) computers. When coupled with a computer running test software, AIO forms a complete system for testing digital and analog audio electronics and acoustics in consumer and professional products. Echo AIO products are ideally suited for a high-volume production environment where testing occurs on a continual basis.

Echo AIO combines the functionality of multiple pieces of test equipment into a single, integrated device for increased reliability at a reduced cost. In addition to audio testing, it has extensive capability to control measurement fixtures, simulate batteries for wearable products, and even measure environmental variables such as temperature, barometric pressure, and humidity, allowing baseline conditions to be established for factory production runs.

![Echo AIO Test System (AIO-SA configuration)](/images/aio/image10.jpg)
*Figure 1: Echo AIO Test System (AIO-SA configuration)*

The Echo AIO Test System is a modular design consisting of a chassis, an interface module with connections for a locking USB 2.0 cable and a locking power cable, and one or two modules selected from a variety of types for analog I/O, digital I/O, or control. The product name is based on the combination of installed modules (i.e.: AIO-SA has one AIO-S and one AIO-A module).

![AIO Rear Panel](/images/aio/image11.png)
*Figure 2: Rear panel*

<Warning>
All Echo AIO products come from the factory in predetermined, fixed configurations. Attempting to change the factory configuration or swapping modules between chassis will cause the AIO to stop working properly and will **void the calibration and the warranty!** Products originally configured with a single module and an empty slot may be returned to a factory authorized service station at a later date to add a second module.
</Warning>

# 2. Installation

## Hardware

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Power">
    Connect the locking power cable supplied with the AIO to the locking IEC C14 power inlet. Both locking and non-locking cables may be used. For reliability, the AIO does not have a power switch. The blue LED on the front panel indicates when power is applied and the AIO is operating.

    ![Locking power cable](/images/aio/image12.jpg)
    *Figure 3: Locking power cable*

    <Info>
    The universal AC input accepts 90 – 264 VAC at 50 or 60 Hz. The AIO, equipment connected to the AIO, and the test computer must all be connected to the same surge-protected power strip.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect USB">
    Connect the Type-B end of the supplied locking USB 2.0 "HI-SPEED" cable to the USB connector on the AIO, and the other end to the host computer. Both locking and non-locking cables may be used.

    ![Locking USB cable](/images/aio/image13.jpg)
    *Figure 4: Locking USB cable*
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Echo Driver Software

### Windows Installation
Download the AIO Windows driver from the downloads section of the Echo website and run the installer. This will install:
- AIO control panel
- Latest firmware
- ASIO driver
- Command-line application

<Info>
Although the AIO will automatically be recognized on Windows 10 or 11 and can function using only Windows' built-in WASAPI driver, we recommend installing the Echo software to add control panel functionality, firmware updates, and ASIO driver support. Most professional audio and test applications support ASIO. The driver will appear in your software as "ASIO Echo AIO".
</Info>

### macOS Installation
For Macintosh computers, support for USB audio is part of the macOS and its audio component, Core Audio. The AIO is automatically detected whenever it is powered on and connected to a Mac USB port.

## 3rd Party Test and Measurement Software

The Echo AIO Test System may be used with a wide variety of 3rd party test and measurement software via the Echo AIO ASIO driver. Because ASIO is a digital interface, all levels are communicated between the hardware and software as digital values, and there's no inherent conversion to actual analog I/O values when using an analog interface.

<Warning>
To properly do the conversion, the software needs to know the correct scaling factor, which defines the relationship between analog voltage and digital full-scale level (0 dBFS). The scaling factors for different types of inputs and outputs are typically different.
</Warning>

### Scaling Factors

| Type | Connector | Module | Scaling Factor |
|------|:---------:|:------:|:--------------:|
| **Outputs** | | | |
| | Line (unbalanced) | AIO-L | 8.0 V/FS |
| | Line (balanced) | AIO-L | 16.0 V/FS |
| | Headphone | AIO-H | 3.0 V/FS |
| | Amplifier/Speaker | AIO-A, -S | 9.545 V/FS |
| **Inputs** | | | |
| | Mic-Line | AIO-A, -H, -L, -S | 161.6 mFS/V |
| | Headphone Impedance VMON | AIO-H | 333.3 mFS/V |
| | Headphone Impedance IMON* | AIO-H | 8.0 FS/V |
| | Speaker Impedance VMON | AIO-S | 80.80 mFS/V |
| | Speaker Impedance IMON* | AIO-S | 161.6 mFS/V |

*Current monitor inputs require special calculation to derive impedance values

# 3. Hardware Configurations

The Echo AIO Test System is available in different hardware configurations (models) depending on the module type and position installed in the chassis. The product name is based on the combination of installed modules (i.e.: AIO-SA has one AIO-S and one AIO-A module).

</Card>

# 5. Analog I/O

## Microphone/Line Inputs

Inputs with BNC connectors are available for connecting:
- Externally polarized microphones
- Prepolarized constant current (CCP/IEPE/ICP, 4 mA) microphones
- Unbalanced line-level inputs

Features under software control via the AIO control panel:
- Input gain (1x, 10x, 100x)
- Constant current supply
- TEDS reading

<Info>
The mic/line inputs accommodate a very wide range of input voltages, from extremely low-level dynamic microphones to line level inputs. Use the lowest gain setting needed for best dynamic range.
</Info>

### TEDS

Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS) is an industry standard (IEEE 1451) memory device attached to a microphone or other transducer, storing:
- Transducer identification
- Calibration data
- Correction data
- Manufacturer information

<Note>
Using TEDS data does not account for the effects of age, temperature, humidity and barometric pressure. Calibration using external calibrators is the recommended best practice.
</Note>

## Line-level Outputs

The AIO-L module has two outputs with Euroblock connectors for connecting line-level devices. The outputs are differential with (+), (-), and ground connections.

## Headphone Outputs

Amplified outputs with Euroblock connectors are provided for driving headphones and earbuds. The Left and Right outputs are single-ended and share a common ground.

### Voltage Monitor on Input 3 (VMON)
Voltage measured directly at the speaker terminals is monitored on input 3 of the AIO-H module using two wires connected from the headphone terminals directly to the (VL) and (VR) remote sense terminals.

### Current Monitor on Input 4 (IMON)
Precision current sense resistors are placed in series with the outputs. The sense resistor voltage can be used to derive the current through the connected driver.

![AIO-H module block diagram](/images/aio/image26.png)
*Figure 11: AIO-H module block diagram*

<Info>
  The left or right channel is selected via the AIO control panel. There are no external connections to these current sense resistors or circuits.
</Info>

## Amplifier Outputs

Amplified (class D) outputs with Euroblock connectors are provided for driving speakers or other devices. The outputs are single ended with (+) and (-) connections. Both outputs are biased at ~7.5V.

<Warning>
**Important:** Amplifier outputs are floating and not ground-referenced. Connecting a speaker or other low-impedance path from one of the outputs to ground will cause the amplifier to shut down. The amplifier will reset and resume normal operation after the fault is removed.
</Warning>

### Voltage Monitor on Input 3 (VMON)
Voltage measured directly at the speaker terminals is monitored on input 3 of the AIO-S module using two separate wires connected from the speaker terminals to the (V+) and (V-) terminals.
By connecting directly at the speakers, the voltage drop across the speaker wires does not affect the measurement.
### Current Monitor on Input 4 (IMON)
A precision 0.1 Ω current sense resistor is placed in series with the + side of the SPKR output for current monitoring and impedance calculation.
The voltage across the sense resistor is monitored on input 4 of the AIO-S module. There are no external connections to this current sense resistor or circuit.
