## **Overview**

The ATS-BT (Acoustic Test System \- Bluetooth) module is a Bluetooth communication module controlled through simple text commands. Send commands over a serial connection, and the module handles all the Bluetooth complexity for you. Perfect for acoustic testing, audio development, and test automation.

**What you'll do in the next:** Connect the hardware → Open a terminal → Send your first command → Control Bluetooth functions

The ATS-BT module features S/PDIF digital IO with connectivity through micro BNC ports. It can run stand-alone and will connect to any S/PDIF capable interface.  

## **Step 1: Connect Your Hardware**

</div>

**Figure 2:  ATS  rear view showing where ATS-BT connects to the ATS.**

Just three connections are need to get started:

1. **USB**: Connect a USB type C cable to the device and the host computer  
2. Connect the **OUTPUT** of the BT module to the **INPUT** on the ATS  
3. Connect the **INPUT** of the BT module to the **OUTPUT** on the ATS

The TX/RX swap is intentional—the module receives what you transmit and vice versa.

**Power & Status:**

The module is powered via USB \- no external power supply needed  
The blue LED indicates status:  
  * **Solid White**: Initializing  
  * **Rapid Blinking**: In Bluetooth Pairing Mode  
  * **Slow Blinking:** Bluetooth Connected or Idle  
  * **Off**: No power or Idle

## **Step 2: Configure Your Terminal**

### **On Windows**

Download PuTTY from putty.org if you don't have it already.

### **Find your com port**

Open Device Manager (press Windows+X, then M) and look under "Ports (COM & LPT)". Note your COM port number—probably something like COM3 or COM4. It will be listed as a “USB Serial Device”.

Open PuTTY and:

1. Click "Serial" as the connection type  
2. Enter your COM port number (like COM3)  
3. Change Speed from 9600 to **115200**  
4. Click "Open"

Your PuTTY terminal settings should look like this:

For the best user experience, configure these terminal settings:

* **Local echo**: Force on (so you can see what you type)  
* **Implicit CR in every LF**: On (proper line endings)  
* **Implicit LF in every CR**: On (proper line endings)

## **Step 3: Try These Essential Commands**

Now let's explore what your module can do. Type each command as shown (lowercase is ok) and press Enter:

### **Get Module Information**

Type the following command:

```bash
VERSION
```

This returns your module's firmware version. You'll see something like:

```
ATS-BT
Copyright 2025 Echo Audio Test + Measurement
Firmware: 1.0.3
```

### **Get Your Module's Bluetooth Address**

Type the following command:

```bash
GET LOCAL_ADDR
```

You'll receive a 12-character address like:

```
LOCAL_ADDR=112233445566
OK
```

### **See All Settings**

Type the following command:

```bash
CONFIG
```

This displays all 

current configuration parameters. It's a longer response showing various settings like device name, audio configuration, and enabled features.

### **Scan for Nearby Bluetooth Devices**

Type the following command:

```bash
INQUIRY 10
```

This scans for 10 seconds and shows discoverable devices:

```
PENDING
INQUIRY 001122334455 "iPhone" 2C0404 -45 dBm
INQUIRY AABBCCDDEEFF "Galaxy Buds" 2C0404 -62 dBm
OK
```

The numbers at the end (like \-45) indicate signal strength in dBm \- closer to 0 means stronger signal. The six-byte hex code (like 2C0404) is the device's Class of Device identifier.

### **Check Connection Status**

Type the following command:

```bash
STATUS
```

This tells you if you're connected to any device:

```
STATE CONNECTABLE[ON] DISCOVERABLE[ON] ADVERTISING[ON] SCAN_UNI[OFF] AUTOCONN[OFF] OPENANY[OFF]
```

**What These Mean:**

* **CONNECTABLE[ON]** - Other devices can connect to you
* **DISCOVERABLE[ON]** - Other devices can find you in scans
* **ADVERTISING[ON]** - Actively broadcasting availability
* **SCAN_UNI[OFF]** - Unicast scanning (typically off)
* **AUTOCONN[OFF]** - Automatic connection (typically off)
* **OPENANY[OFF]** - Accept any connection (typically off for security)

**Well done\!** You've just verified communication, identified your module, and scanned for devices. You're now ready to start using the ATS-BT module.

## 

## 

## **Step 4: Your First Bluetooth Connection**

### **Connect to a Device**

To connect to headphones, earbuds or another device, first put the device into pairing mode and use the INQUIRY 5 command to search for discoverable devices. Then from your scan results, pick a device and connect using its address.

Type the following command:

```bash
PAIR 001122334455
```

You'll see:

```
PENDING
PAIR_OK 0 001122334455
```

### **Open a Music stream over A2DP (Classic)**

Type the following command:

```bash
OPEN 001122334455 A2DP
```

You'll receive:

```
PENDING
OPEN_OK 10 A2DP 001122334455
OPEN_OK 11 AVRCP 001122334455
ABS_VOL 11 59
```

**Understanding Link IDs:** The numbers (10, 11) are Link IDs that identify connections:

* First digit (1): Device number (if multiple devices connected)
* Second digit (0 - C): Profile type (0=A2DP audio, 1=AVRCP control)

### **Play the Music stream**

Type the following command:

```bash
MUSIC 10 PLAY
```

You'll see:

```
OK
ABS_VOL 11 59
A2DP_STREAM_START 10
```

This command will start music playback for the connected device over A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile) using the AVRCP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile) to control the playback.

## **Step 5: BLE Audio Stream**

For BLE Audio (LE Audio), we'll use the SCAN command to search for available BLE devices, then establish a connection and stream.

### **Scan for BLE Devices**

Type the following command to scan for LE Unicast Receivers:

```bash
SCAN 5 OFF 3
```

This scans for 5 seconds, filtering for LE Unicast Receivers. You'll see devices like:

```
PENDING
SCAN AABBCCDDEEFF "LE Audio Earbuds" -45 dBm
OK
```

### **Pair with the BLE Device**

Type the following command using the address from your scan:

```bash
PAIR AABBCCDDEEFF
```

You'll see:

```
PENDING
PAIR_OK AABBCCDDEEFF
PAIR_OK_LE AABBCCDDEEFF
```

Note the "PAIR_OK_LE" confirmation indicating successful LE (Low Energy) pairing.

### **Open BLE Connection**

First, establish the BLE connection:

```bash
OPEN AABBCCDDEEFF BLE
```

You'll receive:

```
PENDING
OPEN_OK 14 BLE AABBCCDDEEFF
```

### **Open Unicast Transmit Stream**

Now open the audio stream for unicast transmission:

```bash
OPEN AABBCCDDEEFF UTXM
```

You'll see:

```
PENDING
OPEN_OK 18 UTXM AABBCCDDEEFF
LC3_MEDIA_START 18 SOURCE 8 CONTEXT 4
ABS_VOL 18 136
```

The LC3_MEDIA_START indicates the LC3 codec is ready for streaming.

### **Start Audio Playback**

Type the following command:

```bash
MUSIC 18 PLAY
```

You'll receive:

```
OK
```

### **Check Connection Status**

To verify your streaming connection:

```bash
STATUS
```

You'll see detailed connection information:

```
STATE CONNECTABLE[ON] DISCOVERABLE[IDLE] ADVERTISING[ON] SCAN_UNI[OFF] AUTOCONN[OFF] OPENANY[OFF]
LINK 14 CONNECTED BLE AABBCCDDEEFF MTU 250
LINK 18 CONNECTED UTXM AABBCCDDEEFF STREAMING LC3 MEDIA SNK_RATE 
48000 SNK_SDU_INT 10000 SNK_SDU_SIZE 100 SNK_RTN 5 SNK_P_DELAY
40000 SNK_MAX_LAT 95
OK
```

**Understanding the Stream Parameters:**
* **LC3**: Low Complexity Communication Codec (LE Audio codec)
* **SNK_RATE 48000**: 48kHz sample rate
* **SNK_SDU_INT 10000**: 10ms interval between packets
* **SNK_SDU_SIZE 100**: 100 byte packet size
* **SNK_RTN 5**: Retransmission count
* **SNK_MAX_LAT 95**: Maximum latency 95ms

Your BLE Audio stream is now active and transmitting high-quality audio using the LC3 codec!

## **Advanced Terminal Setup**

Once you're comfortable with basic operation, you might want to explore other terminal options or fine-tune your setup.

### **Saving Your Configuration in PuTTY**

Return to PuTTY's configuration window and:

1. Enter your settings (Serial, COM port, 115200 baud)  
2. Type "ATS-BT" in "Saved Sessions"  
3. Click "Save"

Next time, just double-click "ATS-BT" from the saved sessions list to connect instantly.
